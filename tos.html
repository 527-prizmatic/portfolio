						<h2 class="tos-h2">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introduction</h2><br>
						<div class="text-area">
							<p class="text-area">
								By hiring Prizmagistus (the "Artist") to place an order (the "Commission") for one or multiple artworks (the "Product"),
								you (the "Client") agree to comply to the following terms of service.<br>
								Should the Client violate them in any way, or exhibit aggressive behavior (such as harassment or threats) towards the Artist, or find themselves unreasonably overdue on payment,
								their order may be canceled, their rights to whatever has been produced so far withdrawn, and they may be blacklisted from commissioning the Artist in the future.
							</p>

						<h2 class="tos-h2">2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Guidelines</h2><br>
						<div class="text-area">
							<p class="text-area">
								The Artist commits himself to complete the Product in a way that's the most satisfying for both parties, and to regularly inform the Client of the work's progress.
								Commissions are about quality rather than quantity, and as such the Artist will strive to provide the best-quality Product, rather than completing it quickly.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								The Artist accepts to take on any Commission of a type as described in the <a href="services.html"><b>Services</b></a> section,
								and reserves the right to either deny any request that falls outside of this scope.
								Furthermore, the Artist reserves the right to deny a Commission involving the following themes:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Sexually explicit or pornographic content;</li>
								<li>Gore, extreme violence, mutilation;</li>
								<li>Non-humanoid anatomy;</li>
								<li>Other themes the Artist would deem himself not experienced enough to work with to ensure the quality of the product.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="text-area">
								For Commissions other than <b>Reference</b>-type Commissions, the Client is encouraged to provide high-quality references, sketches or detailed descriptions,
								to ensure the Artist can precisely pinpoint the Client's expectations and deliver the best possible product.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								For ease of understanding, all communications regarding Commissions must be in English, French, or German.<br>
								The Artist favors <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/418500799333793812"><b>Discord</b></a> as the primary means of communication.
								Other platforms may be used at the Artist's discretion.
							</p>

						<h2 class="tos-h2">3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customer Satisfaction</h2><br>
						<div class="text-area">
							<p class="text-area">
								The Client can expect between a week and a month for a Commission to be complete. Delays may vary depending on the Artist's schedule.<br>
								If the Client is bound by any kind of deadline, they should inform the Artist of it beforehand, so that an arrangement may be found.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								The Artist engages himself to regular inform the Client of the Commission's advancement. This may take multiple forms:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The Artist will ask the Client for clarification, should anything be unclear.
									The Artist will not take any major decisions regarding composition or character design without the Client's consent.</li>
								<li>The Artist will <b>regularly send the Client downscaled WIPs</b> for them to provide feedback on the Product's progress.
									Back-and-forth should be expected so that both the Artist and the Client may fine-tune their vision of the final Product.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="text-area">
								The Artist's creative process unfolds in three phases:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Sketching</b>. During this phase, the composition is still flexible and no designs are yet set in stone.
								If the Client is unhappy with how a sketch turned out, they may ask for changes to the composition.
								The Artist reserves the right to deny fundamental changes, such as replacing a character with another or changing the scene or action.</li>
								<li><b>Rendering</b>. The composition is largely set in stone but the designs are still flexible.
								This is where the Client may request for design variations, as well as asking for minor changes to the composition.
								Fundamental changes to the composition are not allowed during this phase.
								The Client should request for new backgrounds and environments here, to allow the Artist to prepare the ground for them.</li>
								<li><b>Finalizing</b>. Composition and designs are both set in stone and will accept no further changes.
								Design variations and new environments may still be requested, but the Artist reserves the right to deny if they would be deemed too delicate.</li>
							</ul>
							<p class="text-area">
								Once a Commission has been delivered and officially completed, <b>the Artist will not pursue work any further</b>, unless the Client picks up a genuine error.
								Such errors are limited to oversights from the Artist, and thus do not include anything the Client does not like, or forgot to specify.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								By default, the Artist will keep all works in progress and project files, but the Client may request for the Artist to delete these files.
								Project files will never be shared with the Client.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="h-sep" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>

						<h2 class="tos-h2">4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment</h2><br>
						<div class="text-area">
							<p class="text-area">
								Payment of a Commission is done through <b>PayPal and PayPal only</b>. All payments should be made in USD.<br>
								A commission must have been paid in full before anything is delivered.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								Half of the payment is made as soon as the Artist is ready to work on their Commission.
								Work will not begin until this payment has been provided, and a delay in payment may result in other commissioners taking priority on the Client.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								The rest of the payment is done after the sketching phase. The Artist will not start the finalizing phase until this half of the payment has been made.
								If the Artist reaches the end of the rendering phase before this half of the payment has been made, the Commission will be put on hold until payment is received.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								If the Commission has been put on hold for more than 2 weeks as per the previous paragraph, the Commission will be considered cancelled by the Client,
								and the Artist will stop working on it. Nothing will be delivered, but project files will be kept by the Artist, should the Client wish the Artist to complete it at a later time.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="h-sep" style="margin: 2em 0;"></div>

						<h2 class="tos-h2">5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancelling and Refunding Policy</h2><br>
						<div class="text-area">
							<p class="text-area">
								The Client may cancel a Commission at any time before the beginning of the finalizing phase, although no refunds will be provided.
								If the Client wishes to Commission the Artist again later, either to continue work on the previous Commission or for a new one,
								they will be sent back to the end of the Artist's waiting list.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								If the Client cancels a Commission in progress, the Artist will keep all works in progress and project files unless the Client explicitly asks to delete them.
								This is solely in order to ensure the Artist may pick back up a cancelled Commission if the Client later changes their mind.
							</p>
							<p class="text-area">
								The Artist does not provide any refunds for Commissions cancelled by the Client, nor for delivered and completed Commissions.
								The only situation where a refund would be provided is if, for one reason or another, the Artist finds himself completely unable to begin or pursue work on the commission.

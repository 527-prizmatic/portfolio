								<h2>Meet the Artist!</h2>
								<p class="text-area">
									Prizmagistus (or Prizma for shorts) is a self-taught French artist with more than five years of experience in the field of illustration and character art,
									as well as a musician, conlanger, worldbuilder and game development student.
								</p>
								<p class="text-area">
									I initially began my creative journey with video game fan arts (most notably <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Undertale</em>), and quickly developed my
									own cast of original characters to practice various forms of art. Now I am putting my expertise to your service to bring your own creations to life!

									By exploring my <a href="gallery.html"><b>Gallery</b></a> you can get a first idea of my work method as well as my style.
									I work a lot with contrasting colors, sharp geometrical shapes and thick, powerful lines, all while keeping a largely realistic approach to shapes and anatomy,
									striving for a somewhat techy, futuristic aesthetic. Of course this does not mean I limit myself to futuristic works - I dabble a lot in fantasy and retro-futurism as well.
								</p>
								<p class="text-area">
									I love experimenting with new techniques and trying to integrate them in my tool set, and hope to get to explore entirely new domains through commissions!

									(My apologies in advance to phone users, this mess of a website is only really optimized for desktop as of right now,
									still working on making it work on phone as well)
